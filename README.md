NLP text preprocessing- Noise removal
Noise removal is one of the most essential text preprocessing steps. It is also highly domain dependent.
Noise removal is about removing characters digits and pieces of text that can interfere with your text analysis.
For example, in Tweets, noise could be all special characters except hashtags as it signifies concepts that can characterize a Tweet. 
The problem with noise is that it can produce results that are inconsistent in your downstream tasks.
